# i have a mono repo with Nx that contains 3 applications,
#  one called "my-growth" which is the frontend, other one is "my-growth-e2e"
# and the other one is "api". The "api" application is built with NestJs.
# I want to generate a Github Action to run the Cypress test over "my-growth-e2e"
# but it should run first the "api" app which contains the api logic. The "api" is served using npm run serve:api
# and the cypress test is served using npm nx e2e my-growth-e2e
